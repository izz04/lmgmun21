Since then the MUN club at La Martiniere Girls' College has attended various local and national Model United Nations conferences, achieving accolades in several. In addition to this, the MUN club has also consistently organized workshops and mock sessions in school to help the students gain a better understanding of the activity.</p><br><br>

							<p style="font-family:Montserrat; font-size:14px">Since its foundation in 2014, the La Martiniere Girls' Model United Nations has gone forth to be acknowledged as one of the best conferences in the region. The conference has grown year after year with delegates attending from all corners of the country. In 2016, the innovative step of adding a Joint Crisis Committee to the conference was undertaken so as to provide the students with different perspectives on the same situation. Guided by its motto- Unitas Justitia Spes, (Unity Justice Hope)- LMGMUN strives to continue to grow and achieve greater heights.</p><br><br>

		<td class="gentext" align="justify">DEAR SIR/MADAM,<br><br>It is with utmost pleasure, pride and esteem that I invite you to the 6<sup>th</sup> Chapter of La  Martiniere Girls’ Model United Nations.<br>
        Having completed 150 glorious years, La Martiniere Girls’ College is a legacy in itself. This institution focuses on the holistic development of its students giving equal significance to both academics and co-curricular activities. We, at La Martiniere, are motivated to fly high, and strive for excellence. Carrying forward this very spirit, La Martiniere Girls’ Model United Nations hopes to provide a platform where students can excel in every possible way. <br>
        Today, when we look at the world around us, we see discord and anarchy in politics- we see the imminent dangers to the climate and humanity at large. Our future is uncertain. But the youth is determined to work towards creating an Earth which is conducive to proper development, progress, sustainability, peace and order. A Model United Nations conference is a perfect amalgamation of all forms of constructive debate, diplomacy and consensus to understand the processes of International Politics and Global Issues. 
        La Martiniere Girls' Model United Nations has become one of the most awaited events in the school calendar. With five successful editions behind it, this conference undoubtedly stands as one of the most reputed events in the country. We make necessary efforts to help towards the convergence of over 400 students from all over  the world to discuss issues which hinder the prospect of peace and progress. We are also in collaboration with the United Nations Information Center (UNIC), trying to bring about a real change by getting the UN closer to the people it serves. <br>
     	With this aim in mind, we assure you that this year's conference has much more to offer than ever before. This year, La Martiniere Girls’ Model United Nations promises to aggrandise one’s grasp over foreign affairs, conflict resolution, public speaking and most importantly, teamwork. During this one time of the year, La Martiniere Girls’ College becomes a place of learning and preparation for the leaders of tomorrow. It ensures that each and every participant takes back with them a briefcase full of pleasant memories and a cartload of experience and knowledge.</td>
