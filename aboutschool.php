						<p style="font-family:Montserrat; font-size:14px">A city with a rich cultural heritage, Lucknow has long been regarded as one of the prominent cities of North India. The splendour of the erstwhile Nawabs, evident in monuments such as the Bada Imambada, the savoury Mughlai food and the graciousness of the common language are just some of the attractions that draw people towards Lucknow. The winding streets of Chowk, as once described by the author Attia Hossain, leading into the depths of the city thronging with the rhythm of a lyrical ghazal, remains untouched by time; a delight for the connoisseur and a muse for the surrealist.</p>

						<p style="font-family:Montserrat; font-size:14px">One of Major General Claude Martin’s lasting legacies gave life to La Martinière Girls' College, Lucknow, in 1869. The Lucknow Girls' School, as it was then known, was run by Mrs. Saunders Abbott. Following a land grant from the government the school was moved to its present location at Khursheed Manzil in 1871 and incorporated and established as a branch of La Martinière College. La Martiniere Girls' College pays homage to the rich history of Lucknow; its very own building, the Khursheed Manzil (the Palace of the Sun) was the stronghold for the British troops during the Mutiny of 1857. </p>

						<p style="font-family:Montserrat; font-size:14px">La Martiniere Girls’ College, Lucknow, was established in Moti Mahal premises in 1869 with less than a 100 students and staff. Today, it has 2700 students (110 boarders) and 247 staff. It has always ranked as one of the leading schools of India, and academically, since 2015, it has consistently been rated in the top 10 all-girls boarding schools of India. A school with 150 years of merit behind it, La Martiniere Girls' College continues to believe in providing students with a wide range of capabilities in order to become the leaders of tomorrow instead of the followers of yesterday. The school encourages the youth to shape their own path wherever they go.</p> <br><br><br>
